# I want to party too!

For now, you can run this extension locally. 

```
git clone https://github.com/smarter23/meet-party.git
```

Then go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.
Click on Load unpacked and load the cloned file!

You are now good to go!

On [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), you will see a  :tada:  icon

#Contributing
I'd love for you to contribute to this project! Feel free to add a PR

#Inspiration 
I was inspired by a recent meetup with my school friends and wanted to add an exciting visual to all the fun we had.
I built this project over the weekend, and learnt quite a bit about Chrome Extensions.

Let us all have some fun :tada: :tada: :tada:
